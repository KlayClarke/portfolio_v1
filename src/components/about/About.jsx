        Hi, my name is Klay Clarke and I am a self-taught MERN Stack Developer.

      <h3>About Me:</h3>
      <h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I enjoy exhausting the capabilities of Javascript and Python, hoping
            one day to contribute to the vast tech industry.
          </li>
          <li>
            My interest in web development began when I was 14 years old. While
            attempting to create a clone of Google's landing page, I had failed
            miserably. I possessed neither the expertise, nor the patience to
            succeed.
          </li>
          <li>
            This experience dissuaded me from pursuing Computer Science in
            college, practically forcing me toward the path of Business and
            Finance. College, however, did not work out as I had planned, and I
            ended up switching majors more than I could count.
          </li>
          <li>
            While enrolled in a Sociology course, I was proposed a research
            opportunity by my then professor, Dr. Jeremy Pais. This would turn
            out to be the most important experience of my college career.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using various statistical computing softwares (R and Stata), I was
            able to provide assistance to Dr. Pais in his researching of the
            Neighborhood Disadvantage Index. During this time, I'd come to
            appreciate the beauty and diversity of data analytics, and the tech
            that made it all possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            After playing with these tools for two years, I was not only
            confident, but determined to give coding another shot.

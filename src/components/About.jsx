        My technological interests derived somewhat unconventionally: As a
        Sociology student, I'd fell in love with Stata and R, software that
        helped me understand, analyze and manipulate data while serving as a

        After graduation, I decided to learn more about (1) how these tools
        worked and (2) how a team of engineers built such helpful software. I
        would soon find myself learning (and loving) Javascript and Python
        instead.
